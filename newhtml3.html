      <h1>The Great wall of china</h1>
      <p>The great wall of china is a series of fortifications that were built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century BC,[4] with selective stretches later joined by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China.

The best-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).</p>
